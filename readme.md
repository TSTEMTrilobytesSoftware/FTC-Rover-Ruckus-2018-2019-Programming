## Class Names

Note that some class names are not named in the best conventions possible, and therefore, it is 
highly recommended to look at the Op Mode name(right before class declaration) inside of the java
file so that you can get a better understanding of what the class does. Also, reading our comments
will ensure that you understand how our program runs.
